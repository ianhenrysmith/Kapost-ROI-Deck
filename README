So I'm using haml, coffeescript and sass here cause it's better that way.
Not sure if they'll work out of the box so to get started:

  1) this will get sass set up to watch for sass changes:
      sass --watch stylesheets/sass:stylesheets/css
  2) this will generate index.html (not automatic):
      haml haml/index.haml index.html
  3) this will get coffeescript set up to watch for coffeescript changes:
      coffee -o js/ -cw js/coffeescripts
      
      you'll need to install node.js in order to get coffeescript to work.
      
      
The three main files here are haml/index.haml, stylesheets/sass/main.sass and js/coffeescripts/main.coffee

We're also using jquery.pitchdeck.js, which handles the pitch-deck-ification of the page. There's a decent example implementation of it at http://investors.dressrush.com/ .


Note about positioning clouds: I've just been giving them inline style, since it would be kind of silly to give each its own class.
